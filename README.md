# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Behavior and Rendering Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with Tailwind CSS: unexpected behavior or rendering issues due to class conflicts, improper usage, or interactions between different utility classes.  The problem might manifest as elements not displaying correctly, unintended spacing, or misaligned components.  The solution highlights best practices to identify and resolve such problems.

## Bug Description:
The example code exhibits a potential problem related to the interaction of flexbox utilities with other Tailwind classes. The red box may not be positioned or spaced as intended depending on the Tailwind version, configuration, or browser. Other potential issues include unpredictable behavior when using responsive modifiers or when combining multiple utilities affecting the same CSS property. 

## Solution:
The provided solution focuses on careful review of Tailwind's documentation, debugging tools, and the use of the browser's developer tools to understand the generated CSS and identify conflicting styles. In addition to using the right tools, understanding the order of the classes and the specificity of your selectors is important.
