// Potential solutions might include:

// 1. Verify Tailwind CSS configuration and class names:
// Check your Tailwind configuration file (tailwind.config.js) to ensure that all necessary plugins and configurations are correct.
// Double-check for typos or incorrect class names. 

// 2. Inspect the generated CSS:
// Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the actual CSS applied to the elements. This helps in identifying conflicting styles or unexpected CSS rules.

// 3. Use the `@apply` directive (if needed): 
// If you are using custom styles or overriding default styles, use the `@apply` directive in the `tailwind.config.js` file. This enables a cleaner style management. 

// 4. Use Tailwind's debugging tools:
// Some Tailwind CSS implementations include dedicated debugging tools to inspect applied classes, layer styles and highlight potential issues. Consult your Tailwind CSS documentation for such functionalities.  

// 5. Simplify and Isolate the Issue:
// For complex layouts, break down components into smaller pieces and test each part independently.  It can be helpful to remove other classes to see the exact effect of the specific class being debugged.

// 6. Inspect for class ordering and specificity:
// Correct order of classes matters and specificity in CSS can override intended styles. If there are conflicts between classes, make sure the most specific class comes last.

// Example of improved code (depending on the specific issue):
<div class="flex items-center space-x-4">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <!-- Some content -->
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Some text next to the red box</p>
  </div>
</div>
